![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blk-io/epirus-free/master/images/Contracts.png "Epirus Free")

## Introduction

This dockerized environment is designed for viewing private 
[Quorum](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum), [Pantheon](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon-quickstart/tree/master/privacy) and [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) networks.

## Usage

Clone the repo, navigate to the cloned directory and run the instance with:

```bash
NODE_ENDPOINT=http://<node_endpoint> docker-compose up
```

Note that if setting `NODE_ENDPOINT` to a local Ethereum instance, you may need to use the IP address associated with the Docker bridged interface, often denoted by `docker0`.

Append the `-d` argument to run the containers in the backgroud

You will be able to access the Explorer UI via:

* http://localhost/

To stop the containers use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To connect to new network you should remove the volumes associated with the old network

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## Limitations
